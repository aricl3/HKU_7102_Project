# Five Question
## Q1 What is the research problem and data analysis objectives you would like to do? 

### Research Problem:
1. Where can I find the [datasets](#q2-which-data-sources-and-data-files-will-you-use-for-data-analysis) of knowledge from **entrepreneurship websites, and social media analysis**.Further more, Which entrepreneurship websites, and social media analysis are worthy of our reference? 

2. If we have these data, then the primary research problem is to determine **how data mining and text analysis can be utilized** to support entrepreneurship development.

3. How to clean the data that we collected?

4. What is the final goal that needs to be achieved for this project and to what extent it needs to be completed?

### Analysis objectives:
1. **Keyword Extraction from Internet Sources or Social Media**: Use advanced data mining models to extract keywords from internet sources or social media to build a comprehensive knowledge base. This aims to capture the most relevant and current trends, topics, and information in the entrepreneurship domain.

2. **Classification of Enquiry Topics**: Implement classification models and/or text analysis models to classify the topics of inquiries made to the Chatbot. This helps in efficiently retrieving the most relevant information from the knowledge base to answer user queries.

3. Search and Selection of **Potential Pages for Answers**: Employ advanced data mining and text analysis models to search for potential pages that could contain answers to the questions posed by users. Select the most relevant pages to ensure the information provided is accurate and pertinent.


## Q2 Which data sources and data file(s) will you use for data analysis?  

### Data Sources

1. Entrepreneurship Websites: Websites such as **Entrepreneur, Forbes Entrepreneurs, Small Business Administration (SBA), and specific industry blogs** can provide a wealth of information on business strategies, market trends, and case studies.

2. Social Media Platforms: Analyzing data from platforms like **LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram** can offer insights into current trends, consumer behavior, and competitive analysis. This includes posts, hashtags, and discussions related to entrepreneurship and specific market segments.

3. Business News Outlets: Websites like **Bloomberg, CNBC, and Business Insider regularly publish articles, reports, and interviews** that can provide up-to-date information on market dynamics, startup success stories, and emerging industries.

4. Academic and Research Databases: Accessing papers, reports, and case studies from databases like **Google Scholar, JSTOR, and SSRN** can provide in-depth knowledge on theoretical and applied research in entrepreneurship.


### Data Files:

1. Text Files and Articles (.txt, .pdf): Many of the sources mentioned will provide content in text format, including articles, reports, and case studies, which are ideal for text analysis and keyword extraction.

2. Datasets (.csv, .xlsx): Structured data from research databases or industry reports often come in CSV or Excel formats, suitable for statistical analysis and modeling.

3.  Social Media Data (.json, .csv): Data extracted from social media platforms can be in JSON format (for detailed API responses) or CSV (for processed and structured data), useful for sentiment analysis and trend spotting.

4. Public Databases (.sql, .csv, .xlsx): Government and industry reports might be available in various formats, including SQL database dumps or structured Excel sheets, providing comprehensive datasets for analysis.



## Q3 How will you use the selected data for statistical analysis? 

1. [Data Cleaning & Data Preprocessing](#q4-what-data-cleanning-and-data-pre-processing-will-you-do-on-your-collected-data)
2. Keyword Extraction
- Frequency Analysis: Identify the most frequently occurring words or phrases within the text data to highlight trending topics or areas of interest.
- TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency): Determine the importance of words within documents relative to a collection of documents. This helps in identifying keywords that are unique and significant to specific documents.
3. Topic Modeling and Classification
- LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation): Use LDA for topic modeling to discover the hidden thematic structure in large archives of text data. This can help in classifying content into predefined categories based on the identified topics.
- Supervised Machine Learning Models: Train classification models (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest) on labeled data to classify inquiries and content into relevant topics or categories.
4. Sentiment Analysis
- Polarity Scores: Use sentiment analysis tools to assign polarity scores (positive, negative, neutral) to text data, which can be useful for understanding public sentiment towards certain topics or products.
5. Trend Analysis
- Time Series Analysis: For data with timestamps, perform time series analysis to identify trends over time. This can be particularly useful for tracking the popularity of topics or sentiment towards them.
6. Predictive Modeling
- Regression Analysis: Use regression models to predict numerical outcomes based on input variables. For example, predicting the potential market size based on certain economic indicators.
- Classification Models for Prediction: Implement models to predict categorical outcomes, such as the likelihood of success for a startup in a particular industry based on historical data.
7. Integration into Dashboard
- Data Visualization: Use tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly in Python to create visualizations that can be integrated into a dashboard. Visualizations like bar charts, line graphs, and heatmaps can make the statistical findings accessible and actionable.
- Dashboard Development: Utilize dashboard development platforms (e.g., Dash by Plotly, Tableau) to create an interactive interface that displays analytics results, trends, and predictions derived from the statistical analysis.
8. Continuous Learning and Updating
- Feedback Loop: Incorporate user feedback and interactions with the chatbot to refine and update the models. This ensures the chatbot evolves with changing trends and user needs.

By following these steps, the selected data can be effectively used for statistical analysis, providing the foundation for a knowledge-driven chatbot that supports entrepreneurship development through actionable insights and recommendations.





## Q4 What data cleanning, and data pre-processing will you do on your collected data?

### Data Cleaning
1. Remove Duplicates: Identify and remove any duplicate records to prevent skewed analysis results.
2. Handle Missing Values: Assess the nature of missing data and decide on an appropriate strategy for each case, such as filling missing values with the mean/median for numerical data or the mode for categorical data, or removing records with missing values if they are not significant.
3. Correct Errors: Manually or programmatically correct any obvious errors in the data, such as typos in text data or incorrect values in numerical data.
### Data Pre-processing
1. Normalization/Standardization: Scale numerical data to a standard range or distribution, which is important for models that are sensitive to the scale of input features, such as distance-based algorithms.
2. Encoding Categorical Variables: Convert categorical variables into a format that can be provided to ML models, using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.
3. Tokenization: Break down text data into smaller units, such as words or phrases, making it easier to analyze.
4. Stop Words Removal: Eliminate common words that add little value to the analysis, such as "the", "is", and "in", to reduce the dataset size and improve processing time.
5. Stemming and Lemmatization: Reduce words to their root form or base form. While stemming cuts off prefixes and suffixes, lemmatization considers the context and converts the word to its meaningful base form.
6. Feature Extraction: Transform raw data into numerical features that can be used for modeling. For text data, techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) can be used to reflect the importance of words within documents.


### Additional Considerations
- Data Integration: If data is collected from multiple sources, ensure that it is integrated coherently, aligning similar columns and harmonizing units or categories.
- Data Reduction: Reduce the dimensionality of the data if necessary, using techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA), to improve model performance and reduce computational cost.
- Handling Imbalanced Data: In classification problems, balance the dataset if one class significantly outnumbers the other, using techniques like oversampling, undersampling, or SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).
